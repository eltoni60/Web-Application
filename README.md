# Web-Application
CS 419 web application: Code name GCTV
This is the project for the CS 419 Java Programing and Web Development at Elmhurst College Fall 2018 semester.

The purpose of the project is to build a video streaming service for a client. 
During a mock meeting, the client expressed their design needs.

Our goal was to implement the client's design needs usgin Java programing language, Apache Tomcat Server, MySQL Database system and any web
design framework of our choosing. 

Classes were designed to hold information that is would be retrieved from the database as well as static classes to retrieve the the information
and store them in instances of the classes.

Servlets were also implemented to do validate and produce the correct data to display in the Java server pages that made up the web application.

The following are screen shots of the web application running.
